Bellow are the prompts to Chat GPT o1
A namesake of which this project has. 


================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Prompt 1

I need you to write ma a desktop app. 
Something Executable that will run in an exe.
This application will hijack the combination of keys ' Ctrl + o" ; 
Once this key combo is hit, the application will behave the same as the windwows snipping tool -> Screenshotting the entire display, and then allow the cropping of a portion of this screenshot using the mouse. 
For version 1, we will then save this cropped image on desktop, with a random, 8 characters name .jpeg.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================


Prompt 2
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
The ultimate goal of this project is to create a quick, screenshot based communication with chatgpt4o, and as your capabilities evolve, you.


So, lets iterate. 

For the second version: 
1. A Settings Menu:

    1. Lets add a small settings menu that will open after the application is in screenshot mode (So after the Ctrl + o keys have been triggered), and the RIGHT click is clicked.
    2. On that right mouse click it will open a context menu like menu, wherever the mouse pointer is. 
    This menu will be of similar size to the windows "right click" context menu. As for design, use whatever you think looks good, but discrete and modest.
    3. The options on this menu will be : 
        1. API Key -> the API Key to authenticate to chat GPT
        2. httpRequest UL -> What link are we connecting to? Use whatever technology necessary in order to connect to the OpenAI Platform and communicate via http requests.
        3. Save screenshot location -> A folder path on disk where to store the screenshots
        4. A Save settings button -> saves current settings, and reenters the screenshot snip wizard
        5. Cancel -> reverts settings to last known configuration, and reenters the screenshot wizzard

2. General settings: 

    Pressing the any of the following keys will exit the wizard and/or settings menu without saving anything:
    ESC key
    ctrl + q
    ctrl + c
    shift + 1


3. A new Window: 
    1. The screenshot will now be kept on screen inside a new Windows window. 
        -> The image will be kept in its natural size, but up to a maximum of 800x600 pixels. Anything larger will be compressed to this size.
    2. On the right of the screenshot, delimited by some vertical line, but still inside this new window we will have the response to the screenshot.
        -> Visually, for the user, we will have a loading circle until the response from the AI model used is returned, then displayed
        -> The reply will appear like in the chat window of chat gpt, with code snippets, rich text, a scroll bar to scroll the through answer and a copy code button. 
        -> Also, like with chat gpt 4, there should be the the Reply functionality.

First things is first: 
Please use as many tokens / replies as you see fit in order to get this answer right. 

Please feel free to separate the code into as many files as you see fit (such as for styling, any particular framework you want to use, etc.) And on this note please keep in mind that the name of this second version of the project is Project 0 1
